              when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type

              electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
              in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
              and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
              versions of Lorem Ipsum.
